There are several ways to install the Lexity Live for WP e-Commerce depending on your needs, experience and web server configuration.

= Easy Installation for End Users =
The easiest way to install is to search the WordPress plugin repository and let WordPress do the work for you. Just take these steps:

1. Visit the _"Plugins/Add New"_ menu option in the WordPress admin.
1. Type _"Lexity Live"_ in the search box and click the _"Search Plugins"_ button.
1. Find the _"Lexity Live for WP e-Commerce"_ in the name column.
1. Click the _"Install Now"_ link under the plugin name
1. Click the _"OK"_ button when asked if you are sure.
1. Wait for WordPress to download and install the plugin.
1. Click the _"Activate"_ link to activate the plugin.
1. Then jump to the section below labeled _"After Plugin Activation."_

= Installation by .ZIP File Upload =
If you are a little more technical, have the plugin as a .ZIP file on your computer and you either cannot or don't want to use the easy install method above you can upload directly. Here's how:

1. Wait until the plugin is uploaded to your server.

1. Then jump to the section below labeled _"After Plugin Activation."_

Note this method will not work if another copy of the plugin already exists on the web server. If so, deactivate and then delete that plugin and then you can use the upload method in this section.
